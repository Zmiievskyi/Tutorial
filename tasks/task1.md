# Task 1 (real one)

## Part 1: "Max 3" 

Write a function (let's call it `getmax3`), that receives array of integers and returns array of 3 biggest numbers from that array.

## Part 2: Cover with tests

Write a function, that calls `getmax3` with some example data and checks that returned values are correct

## Part 3: Explore the performance

Write a function, that calls `getmax3` with rapidly-growing random input data (10,100,1000 ... random integers) and prints execution time. 
Something like 

```
10 0.001s
100 0.01s
1000 0.1s
```

should appear in your console.

Is it linear? If no, why? What can be done with it?
